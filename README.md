# TextScroller
Simple Python script I wrote to turn my profile picture on discord into a gif with scrolling text

It can be operated on the command line with "python autop.py "This is example text"

it will also spit out a random inspiro bot message if the argument is I : "python autop.py I"

if you do input no arguments it will run with the default text in test.py
